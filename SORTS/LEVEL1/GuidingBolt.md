A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. 

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **4d6 radiant damage**, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has **advantage**, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

*At Higher Levels* - When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
